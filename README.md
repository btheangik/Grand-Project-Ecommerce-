# Grand-Project-Ecommerce-
I am building a fully functional e-commerce website. My plan is to have seller accounts where sellers can create their own stores and add products to sell. Buyers will be able to browse and purchase products from the website. I am using React.js for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend.
